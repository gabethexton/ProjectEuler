    /*This is code intended to solve Problem 1 of Project Euler */

    /*Problem 1 states:
    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
    The sum of these multiples is 23.
    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.*/

    /*I wrote this from scratch without external input on Pi Day 2016*/
    /*Because I could, that's why.*/

    /*Sets a variable to total the applicable multiples.*/
    var total = 0;

    /*Sets up a counting loop with conditions.*/
    for (var counter = 0; counter < 1000; counter ++) {
      /*Checks for multiples of 3 and adds them to total*/
      if (counter % 3 === 0) {
        total = total + counter;
        /*Checks for multiples of 5 and adds them to total*/
